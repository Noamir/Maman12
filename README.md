Open Uni, Java course, November 2021


Hi Tomer! 
Thank you so much for reviewing this with \ for me (:

Few things - 
1. In the src folder you will find 3 classes, and 3 testers provided by the Uni.

2. All the API documantations were provided to us, so it's a copy paste, not my words.

    Still - if you find any mistake of think about corrections - please let me know.

3. I added the assignment file in the root of this repo. (pdf file)

4. I added along the code some TODOs, so I won't forget to go back to them.
These places are a bit confusing to me, not sure my implemetation is the best.
See them as questions.


Again - Thanks a lot!!
And I love you <3
