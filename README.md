Hi Tomer! 
Thank you so much for reviewing this with \ for me (:

Few things - 
1. All the API documantations were provided to us, so it's a copy paste, not my words.
Stil - if you find any mistake of think about corrections - please let me know.

2. I added the assignment file in the root of this repo. (pdf file)

3. I added along the code some TODOs, so I won't forget to go back to them.
These places are a bit confusing to me, not sure my implemetation is the best.
See them as questions.


Again - Thanks a lot!!
And I love you <3
